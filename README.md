# 🗜️ Data Compression & Decompression Portal

A full-stack web application that allows users to **compress and decompress files** using standard algorithms such as **Huffman Coding**, **Run-Length Encoding (RLE)**, and **LZ77**. It supports multiple file formats—text, images, and binary—and provides real-time previews, compression analytics, and a smooth, responsive interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📁 Upload and process files of various formats (text, images, binaries)
- 🔄 Compress & decompress using:
  - Huffman Coding
  - Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
  - LZ77
- 🖼️ Live preview of uploaded files (text and image)
- 📊 View detailed compression statistics:
  - Original vs. Compressed Size
  - Compression Ratio
  - Time Taken
- ⚠️ File-type-based algorithm recommendations
- 📥 Download compressed/decompressed files with correct extensions
- 💡 Modern and responsive UI styled with Tailwind CSS

Let me know if you want me to:
- Add demo images/GIF sections
- Write documentation for individual algorithms (Huffman, RLE, LZ77)
- Add deployment steps (like for Vercel or Heroku)

I can also export this to a `.md` or `.pdf` if needed.
